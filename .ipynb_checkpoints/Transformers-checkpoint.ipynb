Prior to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the prevailing stance was that sexual relationships were private matters to be discussed between sexual partners, however HIV itself has gone a long way towards putting women's sexual and reproductive health and rights on to international and national agendas. The International Conference on Population and Development (Cairo) and the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing) called due attention to the impact of gender on sexual relations, reproductive health decision-making and the transmission of HIV/AIDS. \",\n",

Since women are the key promoters of child health, providing them with accurate and timely information is a means of improving the health of the entire family. Yet access to knowledge is ineffective unless accompanied by the power to make and implement informed decisions. Programs that target vertical transmission work through antenatal health services to test pregnant women for HIV infection, offering pre- and post-test counseling and ARV to those women who test positive. These services are on a voluntary basis however. Many women, especially in the Caribbean will refuse to be counseled or tested for HIV, whether due to lack of knowledge or fear of stigmatization. A recent study however, indicates increasing acceptance rates for HIV testing (following counseling) among pregnant women in the region.',\n",

However, trafficking survivors are themselves often treated like criminals instead of crime victims. If a trafficked person is able to eventually access services, key questions arise regarding HIV/AIDS, including: patient confidentiality, mandatory/voluntary testing, confidential HIV testing, treatment, mental health support and repatriation issues.

       "'How gender affects health, and the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in particular, is striking and must be taken into consideration for effective planning and surveillance. Eastern Europe and Central Asia represent unique HIV contexts, very different from the situations in Sub-Saharan Africa or Western Europe. The region faces considerable challenges in order to stop the accelerating spread of HIV among very young women and men, as well as to improve the inadequate prevention of MTCT and the incomplete and often discriminating follow-up and care for PLWHA. Eastern European and Central Asian societies display traditional gender norms where men are expected to ignore or even seek risks associated with IDU or high-risk sex. Women on the other hand often lack the power to choose their sexual relations and their bodies may be considered as potential transactional goods. The threat of HIV has not yet been taken seriously by governments or by the general population and HIV is still regarded as a “drug-users disease” that IDUs themselves are responsible for. Due to recent increased funding, the HIV issue has become more prominent at policy level, but it is still prioritised among ”health and social issues” rather than seen as a national concern. A very high prevalence of IDU related risk-behaviour among young people, particularly men, is triggering the epidemic, and the socially marginalized status of the majority of HIV-positive individuals makes secondary prevention activities difficult. Attitudes of discrimination against young IDU are widespread including the denial of monitoring and ART to IDUs with HIV. This discrimination exacerbates this group’s feelings of unimportance and social marginalisation, in turn fuelling protest and escape-related risk-behaviours. Laws prohibiting discrimination are already in place, but they are not enforced by governments or practised by providers. IDU is not a moral issue, neither is it merely a consequence of poverty, societal disruption, hopelessness or fatalism. IDU is, to a large extent, driven by gender stereotypes that push young people, predominantly men, to seek risks and experiment with drugs, and to display their macho-behaviour through injection and peer solidarity through needle sharing. Many girls appear to be introduced to drugs through their boyfriends. Among the youngest age group, the proportion of IDUs who are girls appears to be increasing, but whether this is due to increasing abuse or more openness among young women is not known. Sex work and the trafficking of young women and children have exploded in the region during the last decade, exposing the involved individuals to very high risks of STI and HIV. Due to the large numbers of young women who pass through the commercial sex industry, the risk of spreading HIV to the general population either through their clients or through their own partners is obvious. Unemployed women with families to support or with on-going drug abuse habits may see sex work as their only source of income. This view is steered by cultural gender expectations that women’s bodies may be sold. Dreams of a better life or more money make many young women and girls vulnerable to deception into trafficking abroad or to relocation to larger cities where they are exploited in the sex industry. These women are very disempowered in terms of changing their situation, still, they receive little help from the police and their destiny is of surprisingly low priority for legislators. Gender mainstreaming is not costly in terms of financial resources but it requires an increased awareness of the importance of creating gender-sensitive HIV prevention, care and surveillance programmes. This is not only important for the sake of equity, but because large groups of vulnerable people are not being reached by current campaigns and services which often lack sensitivity both in terms of gender and ethnicity. Thus, in order to effectively reduce the drug-mediated spread of HIV, the potential for sexual transmission into the general population, as well as the provision of just and equal care to all women and men affected and infected by HIV, gender aspects should be taken into account for successful implementation and design of programmes for HIV/AIDS prevention and care.

      "{'_id': ObjectId('6093c92a2799b9616a6f8a11'), 'heading': '6. Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes.

This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios—the “NASCOP scenario,” based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the “Standard scenario,” based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient.

Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17}\n",

Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n"

To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios—the “NASCOP scenario,” based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the “Standard scenario,” based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient. As shown in Table E1, implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines under the Standard scenario will cost about 20 percent more than under the NASCOP scenario. The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17–2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment. In both scenarios, key commodities (ARVs, laboratory management, and test kits) are the main cost drivers, accounting for 61 percent of the total cost (seeTable E1).

The lack of variation between the two scenarios is explained by an assumption that an equal population will require PEP in both cases, because PEP population estimates were based on programme data and are the same in both scenarios. It is also assumed that ARVs for PEP are included under general adult ARV cost estimates. Therefore, the main cost elements were identified as additional HIV testing and kidney tests needed for the PEP programme due to use of a TDF regimen. 13 ', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [1, 0]}, 'importance': 1}\n",
