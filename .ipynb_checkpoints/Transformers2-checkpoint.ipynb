       "'Nineteen services mentioned by MSM were visited in Yaounde including ten public facilities, four private clinics and five CBO/NGOs. 13/19 services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. Seventeen had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and four had undertaken specialized sessions (for MSM or FSW), twelve had provided ARV medication in last month and only one did not report ARV shortages in the last 12 months. It is noteworthy that of the four services mentioned by at least 10% of the population, three are associations with limited HCT facilities and no clinical provision. Only one of the top four (Hopital Central) reported having ARV capacity in the past four weeks, while also experiencing at least one ARV stock outage in the last 12 months. Additionally, the most frequently cited center by MSM was Humanity First with 40.1% of respondents identifying it while the next highest center was only identified by 19.7% of the population. In 2011 41.8% of MSM reported having accessed the CAMNAFAW clinic or being reached by Humanity First peer educators or outreach workers in the previous 12 months (CARE 2012). In both Care (2012) and the current study, Humanity First has only been able to reach approximately 40% of the MSM population in HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2013).45 the city. Although Humanity First has not reached the majority of MSM respondents it is the most commonly cited service center. This represents a lack of clinical services in Yaounde since Humanity First does not provide HIV testing or ARV medication. MSM in Yaounde are largely not connected to centers that provide HIV testing, treatment, or care. The low levels of access to HIV services are further evidenced in both MSM and FSW populations by the percent of respondents in the city who failed to identify any health centers that provide HIV services. Of all the cities, Yaounde had the second highest number of each population that reported not seeking or receiving HIV prevention, care, and treatment, with 20.4% MSM and 17.2% of FSW reporting seeking or receiving no health services. Eighteen services mentioned by FSW were visited in Yaounde including twelve public facilities, three private clinics and three CBO/NGOs. Eleven services reported specialized training for staff in dealing with MSM or FSW. Seventeen had undertaken HIV counseling and testing in the past month and three had undertaken specialized sessions (for MSM or FSW), twelve had provided ARV medication in last month and only two did not report ARV shortages in the last 12 months. Of the two top services cited by the FSW population, only one had HIV clinical capacity, as the other was Horizon Femme, the PEPFAR HAPP funded association that provides HCT and referral to clinical services in Yaounde and Douala. It is noteworthy that 17.2% of the FSW population in Yaounde reported not seeking or receiving any HIV prevention, care or treatment service. Overall, this implies the coverage of clinical services for the FSW population in Yaoundé is limited. HIV Prevention for Populations at Risk in Cameroon - final report (4 July 2014).46 '"

Conclusions ', 'text': 'The costing of HIV interventions in this study is based on 2016 HIV guidelines and considers two scenarios: NASCOP and Standard. The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n",
      "{'_id': ObjectId('6093c92a2799b9616a6f8a12'), 'heading': 'Executive Summary ', 'text': 'In 2016, the Ministry of Health (MOH) updated Kenya’s national HIV guidelines to provide guidance on the use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) to treat and prevent HIV infection. To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios—the “NASCOP scenario,” based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the “Standard scenario,” based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient. As shown in Table E1, implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines under the Standard scenario will cost about 20 percent more than under the NASCOP scenario. The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17–2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment. In both scenarios, key commodities (ARVs, laboratory management, and test kits) are the main cost drivers, accounting for 61 percent of the total cost (seeTable E1).

The NASCOP scenario was based on national HIV programme targets towards achievement of 90-90-90, and the Standard scenario was based on the assumption that the guidelines would be fully implemented as spelt out in the 2016 ART guidelines. In the NASCOP scenario, the population base is assumed to be constant for the four-year costing projections, while the Standard scenario adjusts its population in need to consider incidence, mortality, and population growth rates. However, both scenarios considered two key assumptions: the gains obtained from the reduction in HIV mortality and the reduction in HIV incidence rates. Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17}\n",

Findings have shown that the average annual cost of putting a patient on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The Standard scenario costs more than the NASCOP scenario, although differences vary across programme areas. The key biomedical cost drivers in both scenarios were ARTs and laboratory management. Although non-biomedical interventions seemed to be a cost driver, these cost estimates were derived as a proportion of the total cost based on the report of a cost study of HIV treatment conducted in 2013 (U.S. Centers for Diseases Control and Kenya Ministry of Health, (2013), which had an in-depth micro-costing of both medical and non-medical HIV programme interventions. In conclusion, there is an expected escalation in future costs with the implementation of the new 2016 ART guidelines. This is due to inclusion of more people living with HIV in care and treatment programmes, and further enhanced by a reduction in HIV-related mortality. The inclusion of PrEP and PEP as prevention measures might have a significant impact on reducing the HIV incidence rate. This will, however, come with a considerable increase in the resources needed to fund interventions. Therefore, the key policy interventions introduced in the new guidelines center on prevention and acceleration of treatment aimed at reducing HIV incidence rates and related mortalities. This calls for resources to cover an increased number of people targeted for care and treatment programmes. A lowered mortality rate achieved through an ART programme implies increased HIV costs, as the number of people living with HIV who require HIV care will also increase. Kenya must explore channels for financing its increased need for HIV care and treatment. These could include coverage of HIV services in health insurance benefits packages (social or private health insurance), increased domestic resource mobilisation (including allocations from national and county governments), and engaging the private sector to play a bigger role in HIV financing. 20', 'key_words_info': {'key_words': ['HIV', 'sex'], 'counts': [17, 0]}, 'importance': 17, 'country': 'kenya'}\n"

To inform implementation and resource mobilisation, the MOH needed to understand the costing implications of implementing the new guidelines. This created the need for a study to estimate the costs of implementing the new guidelines, based on the country targets and covering all known people living with HIV in Kenya. This study adopted a micro-costing approach using population data from 2015 HIV revised estimates. The study considered two costing scenarios—the “NASCOP scenario,” based on NASCOP (National AIDS/STI Control Programme) targets to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets; and the “Standard scenario,” based on full adoption of the new guidelines. The results show that the average annual unit cost of an adult on ARVs is Ksh 12,032.36 (US$115.7). The unit cost varies by regimen type, with the unit cost of an adults first-line regimen being Ksh 9,501.44 (US$91.4) per year, compared to Ksh 26,499.20 (US$254.8) for second-line. The annual unit cost of pediatric ARVs was estimated at Ksh 17,800.64 (US$171.2) per patient. As shown in Table E1, implementation of the new antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines under the Standard scenario will cost about 20 percent more than under the NASCOP scenario. The estimated cost of implementingthe new guidelines under the NASCOP and Standard scenarios in the next four years (FY2016/17–2019/20) is Ksh 197.8 billion (US$1.9 billion) and Ksh 239.2 billion (US$2.3 billion), respectively. The higher costs under the Standard scenario can explained by the higher number of people living with HIV expected to be initiated on treatment.
